title: "Activity 15 - Multiple linear regeression"
subtitle: "Modelling loan interest rates"
---

The dataset will utilize in this activity is from the **openintro** package about loans from the peer-to-peer lender, Lending Club.
We will use **tidyverse** and **tidymodels** for data exploration and modeling, respectively.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
```

Before we use the dataset, we'll make a few transformations to it.

```{r}
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  mutate(
    credit_util = total_credit_utilized / total_credit_limit,
    bankruptcy  = as.factor(if_else(public_record_bankrupt == 0, 0, 1)),
    verified_income = droplevels(verified_income),
    homeownership = str_to_title(homeownership),
    homeownership = fct_relevel(homeownership, "Rent", "Mortgage", "Own")
    ) %>%
  rename(credit_checks = inquiries_last_12m) %>%
  select(interest_rate, verified_income, debt_to_income, credit_util, bankruptcy, term, credit_checks, issue_month, homeownership) 
```


Here is a glimpse at the data:

```{r}
#| label: glimpse-loans
glimpse(loans)
```
# Interest rate vs. credit utilization ratio

The regression model for interest rate vs. credit utilization is as follows.

```{r}
#| label: fit-rate-util

rate_util_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(interest_rate ~ credit_util, data = loans)

tidy(rate_util_fit)
```

And here is the model visualized:

```{r}
ggplot(loans, aes(x = credit_util, y = interest_rate)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

-   **Your turn:** What is the estimated interest rate for a loan applicant with credit utilization of 0.8, i.e. someone whose total credit balance is 80% of their total available credit?

```{r}
#| label: predict-80

credit_util_80 <- tibble(credit_util = 0.8)

predict(rate_util_fit, new_data = credit_util_80)
```

# Interest rate vs. homeownership

Next we predict interest rates from homeownership, which is a categorical predictor with three levels:

```{r}
levels(loans$homeownership)
```

-   **Demo:** Fit the linear regression model to predict interest rate from homeownership and display a tidy summary of the model. Write the estimated model output below.

```{r}
#| label: fit-rate-home

rate_home_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(interest_rate ~ homeownership, data = loans)

tidy(rate_home_fit)
```

-   **Your turn:** Interpret each coefficient in context of the problem.

    -   Intercept: Loan applicants who rent are predicted to receive an interest rate of 12.9%, on average.

    -   Slopes:

        -   The model predicts that loan applicants who have a mortgage for their home receive 0.866% lower interest rate than those who rent their home, on average.

        -   The model predicts that loan applicants who own their home receive 0.611% lower interest rate than those who rent their home, on average.

# Interest rate vs. credit utilization and homeownership

## Main effects model

-   **Demo:** Fit a model to predict interest rate from credit utilization and homeownership, **without** an interaction effect between the two predictors. Display the summary output and write out the estimated regression equation.

```{r}
#| label: rate-util-home-fit

rate_util_home_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(interest_rate ~ credit_util + homeownership, data = loans)

tidy(rate_util_home_fit)
```

$$
\widehat{interest~rate} = 9.93 + 5.34 \times credit~util + 0.696 \times Mortgage - 0.128 \times Own
$$

-   **Demo:** Write the estimated regression equation for loan applications from each of the homeownership groups separately.
    -   Rent: $\widehat{interest~rate} = 9.93 + 5.34 \times credit~util$
    -   Mortgage: $\widehat{interest~rate} = 10.626 + 5.34 \times credit~util$
    -   Own: $\widehat{interest~rate} = 10.058 + 5.34 \times credit~util$
-   **Question:** How does the model predict the interest rate to vary as credit utilization varies for loan applicants with different homeownership status. Are the rates the same or different?

The same.

## Interaction effects model

-   **Demo:** Fit a model to predict interest rate from credit utilization and homeownership, **with** an interaction effect between the two predictors. Display the summary output and write out the estimated regression equation.

```{r}
#| label: rate-util-home-int-fit

rate_util_home_int_fit <- linear_reg() |>
  fit(interest_rate ~ credit_util * homeownership, data = loans)

tidy(rate_util_home_int_fit)
```

$$
\widehat{interest~rate} = 9.44 + 6.20 \times credit~util + 1.39 \times Mortgage + 0.697 \times Own - 1.64 \times credit_util:Mortgage - 1.06 \times credit_util:Own
$$

-   **Demo:** Write the estimated regression equation for loan applications from each of the homeownership groups separately.
    -   Rent: $\widehat{interest~rate} = 9.44 + 6.20 \times credit~util$
    -   Mortgage: $\widehat{interest~rate} = 10.83 + 4.56 \times credit~util$
    -   Own: $\widehat{interest~rate} = 10.137 + 5.14 \times credit~util$
-   **Question:** How does the model predict the interest rate to vary as credit utilization varies for loan applicants with different homeownership status. Are the rates the same or different?

Different.

## Choosing a model

Rule of thumb: **Occam's Razor** - Don't overcomplicate the situation! We prefer the *simplest* best model.

```{r}
#| label: glance

glance(rate_util_home_fit)
glance(rate_util_home_int_fit)
```

-   **Review:** What is R-squared? What is adjusted R-squared?

R-squared is the percent variability in the response that is explained by our model. (Can use when models have same number of variables for model selection)

Adjusted R-squared is similar, but has a penalty for the number of variables in the model. (Should use for model selection when models have different numbers of variables).

-   **Question:** Based on the adjusted $R^2$s of these two models, which one do we prefer?

The interaction effects model, though just barely.

# Another model to consider

-   **Your turn:** Let's add one more model to the variable -- issue month. Should we add this variable to the interaction effects model from earlier?

```{r}
linear_reg() |>
  fit(interest_rate ~ credit_util * homeownership + issue_month, data = loans) |>
  glance()
```

No, the adjusted R-squared goes down.
