# Introduction

> Which verbs follow "she" and "he" pronouns in Jane Austen novels? Are they similar or different?

**Goal:** Use text mining methods to explore whether verbs that follow she and he pronouns are similar or different.

**Inspirations:**

-   Blog post by Julia Silge: [https://juliasilge.com/blog/gender-pronouns](https://juliasilge.com/blog/gender-pronouns/)
-   Jockers, Matthew, and Gabi Kirilloff. ["Understanding gender and character agency in the 19th century novel."](https://culturalanalytics.org/article/11066.pdf) Journal of Cultural Analytics 2.2 (2016): 11066.

## Packages

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
# install.packages("janeaustenr")
# install.packages("tidytext")
# install.packages("textdata")
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(knitr)
library(janeaustenr) 
```

## Data

The **janeaustenr** package offers a function, `austen_books()`, that returns a tidy data frame of Jane Austen's 6 completed, published novels.

```{r}
#| label: get-data

austen_books <- austen_books() %>%
  filter(text != "")
```

-   **Demo:** Which books are included in the dataset?

```{r}
#| label: books

austen_books %>%
  distinct(book)
```

# Word frequencies

-   **Question:** What would you expect to be the most common word in Jane Austen novels? Would you expect it to be the same across all books?

Answers may vary.

-   **Demo:** Split the `text` column into word tokens.

```{r}
#| label: words

austen_words <- austen_books %>%
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text) # token = "words" by default
```

-   **Your turn:** Discover the top 10 most commonly used words in each of Jane Austen's books.

With stop words:

```{r}
#| label: top-words

austen_words %>%
  count(book, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = book, 
    values_from = n,
    values_fn = as.character,
    values_fill = "Not in top 10"
    ) %>%
  kable()
```

-   **Demo:** Let's do better, without the "stop words".

```{r}
#| label: stop-words

stop_words
```

Without stop words:

```{r}
#| label: top-without-stop-words

austen_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(book, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = word, x = n, fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~book, scales = "free") +
  labs(y = NULL)
```

With better ordering:

```{r}
#| label: top-without-stop-words-better

austen_words %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(book, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder_within(word, n, book), x = n, fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~book, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  labs(y = NULL)
```

# Bigram frequencies

An n-gram is a contiguous series of $n$ words from a text; e.g., a **bigram** is a pair of words, with $n = 2$.

-   **Demo:** Split the `text` column into bigram tokens.

```{r}
#| label: bigrams

austen_bigrams <- austen_books %>%
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  filter(!is.na(bigram))

austen_bigrams
```

-   **Your turn:** Visualize the frequencies of top 10 bigrams in each of Jane Austen's books.

```{r}
#| label: top-bigrams

austen_bigrams %>%
  count(book, bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder_within(bigram, n, book), x = n, fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~book, scales = "free") +
  scale_y_reordered() +
  labs(y = NULL)
```

# Verbs that follow she or he

First, let's define the pronouns of interest:

```{r}
#| label: pronouns

pronouns <- c("he", "she")
```

-   **Demo:** Filter the dataset for bigrams that start with either "she" or "he" and calculate the number of times these bigrams appeared.

```{r}
#| label: bigram-counts

bigram_counts <- austen_bigrams %>%
  count(bigram, sort = TRUE) %>%
  separate(bigram, into = c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  filter(word1 %in% pronouns) %>%
  count(word1, word2, wt = n, sort = TRUE) %>%
  rename(total = n)

bigram_counts
```

-   **Discussion:** What can we do next to see if there is a difference in the types of verbs that follow "he" vs. "she"?

Answers may vary.

-   **Demo:** Which words have about the same likelihood of following "he" or "she" in Jane Austen's novels?

```{r}
#| label: word-ratios

word_ratios <- bigram_counts %>%
  group_by(word2) %>%
  filter(sum(total) > 10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = word1, values_from = total, values_fill = 0) %>%
  arrange(word2) %>%
  mutate(
    she = (she+1)/sum(she+1),
    he = (he+1)/sum(he+1),
    logratio = log(she / he, base = 2)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(logratio))

word_ratios
```

```{r}
#| label: similar-he-she

word_ratios %>% 
  arrange(abs(logratio))

```

-   **Demo:** Which words have different likelihoods of following "he" or "she" in Jane Austen's novels?

```{r}
#| label: different-he-she

word_ratios %>%
  mutate(abslogratio = abs(logratio)) %>%
  group_by(logratio < 0) %>%
  top_n(15, abslogratio) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word2, logratio)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, logratio, color = logratio < 0)) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      x = word, xend = word,
      y = 0, yend = logratio
    ),
    linewidth = 1.1, alpha = 0.6
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 3.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Relative appearance after 'she' compared to 'he'",
    title = "Words paired with 'he' and 'she' in Jane Austen's novels",
    subtitle = "Women remember, read, and feel while men stop, take, and reply"
  ) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "", labels = c("More 'she'", "More 'he'")) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(-3, 3),
    labels = c(
      "0.125x", "0.25x", "0.5x",
      "Same", "2x", "4x", "8x"
    )
  )
```

# Sentiment analysis

One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text as a combination of its individual words and the sentiment content of the whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual words. This isn't the only way to approach sentiment analysis, but it is an often-used approach, and an approach that naturally takes advantage of the tidy tool ecosystem.[^1]

```{r}
#| label: sentiments

sentiments <- get_sentiments("afinn")
sentiments
```

```{r}
#| label: sentiments-he-she

bigram_counts %>%
  left_join(sentiments, by = c("word2" = "word")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = total * value) %>%
  group_by(word1) %>%
  arrange(desc(abs(sentiment))) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)
```
