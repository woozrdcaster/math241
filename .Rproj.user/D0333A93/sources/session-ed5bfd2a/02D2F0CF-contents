Data Set: Week 18 Dallas Animals 

```{r}
readr::read_csv("data/week18_dallas_animals.csv") %>%
  head(n = 5)
dog <- read_csv("data/week18_dallas_animals.csv")
```


This data set uses information from a variety of different animal shelters across the City of Dallas, upon their intake to the shelter. Each observation/row is an individual animal entered by staff into the shelter system. The data is across all animal types including dogs, cats and other wildlife. The data collections the animals health, chip status, breed/species, as well as the time of their intake and the form in which the animal was received. We chose this data set because we are dog lovers and one of our group members is from Dallas and volunteered at a local shelter. It also seemed to have well collected data with a lot of diversity within key variables like dog breed and intake form.

Variables:

1) Animal_id (ID number for each animals)
2) Animal_type (dog, cat, wildlife)
3) Animal_Breed
4) Month (intake month)
5) year (intake Year)
6) Census_tract (Geographical Location)
7) Council_district (Geographical Boundries)
8) Intake_type 
9) Outcome_type 
10) Outcome_date(When animals leave the shelter)
11) Chip_status (is the animal chipped?)
12) animal_origin (How they got the animal)

```{r}
#Code for dataframe dimensions
print(dim(dog))
```

##2 Research Questions:

1. Which city council districts have the highest rate of adoption? (council_district and outcome_type)
Filter outcome_type for observations only including adoptions using dplyr. Quantify how many observations of adoptions there are in each district. Graph using bar graph with ggplot2.

```{r}
#finding number of total adoptions per district in the data frame
dog_adoptions <- dog %>%
  filter(outcome_type == "ADOPTION") %>% 
  group_by(council_district) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_adoptions = n()
  )

# Now let's create the plot
ggplot(data = dog_adoptions, aes(x = council_district, y = n_adoptions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Council District", y = "Number of Adoptions") +
  ggtitle("Dog Adoptions by Council District")
```

```{r}
#trying to make a map
dallas_districts <- st_read("data/Councils/Councils.shp")

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = dallas_districts)


```

```{r}
#joining the adoption data to the shape file
adoptions_map <- dallas_districts %>%
  st_transform (4326) %>%
  inner_join(dog_adoptions, by = c("DISTRICT" = "council_district"))

```

```{r}

#making a choropleth map of dog adoptions by district
tm_shape(adoptions_map) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "n_adoptions", 
              style = "quantile", 
              palette = "BuGn", 
              title = "adoptions by council district") + 
  tm_layout( 
            main.title.position = "center", 
            legend.outside = TRUE)


```



2. What types of animal intake tend to stay longer in shelters?
Mutate new variable for duration of stay with dplyr, bar graph with error bars for average stay (y axis) and type of intake (x axis) with ggplot2

```{r}
#Making a duration variable using dplyr
dog_duration <- dog %>%
   mutate(intake_date = mdy(intake_date),
         outcome_date = mdy(outcome_date)) %>%
  mutate(duration = difftime(outcome_date, intake_date, units = "days")) %>%
  mutate(duration = as.vector(duration))

#Getting summary statistics for average duration
dog_duration_summary <- dog_duration %>%
  group_by(intake_type) %>%
  summarize(average_duration = mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_duration = sd(duration, na.rm = TRUE),
            count_types = n()) 

#Graphing violin plot (all data)
ggplot(dog_duration, aes(x = intake_type, y = duration)) +
  geom_violin() +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 8) +
  labs(x = "Intake Type", 
       y = "Duration of Stay", 
       title = "Shelter Intake Types and Durations in Dallas Animal Shelters in 2016 and 2017")

#Graphing bar graph, sd is larger than mean which means there is abnormal distributions
ggplot(dog_duration_summary) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = intake_type, y = average_duration), 
           stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = intake_type, 
                    ymin = average_duration - sd_duration, 
                    ymax = average_duration + sd_duration)) +
    labs(x = "Intake Type", 
       y = "Duration of Stay with Error Bars", 
       title = "Shelter Intake Types and Durations in Dallas Animal Shelters in 2016 and 2017")

#Graphing histograms, y scale is messed up because stray has many more observations than other groups
ggplot(dog_duration, aes(x = duration)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~intake_type) +
  labs(x = "Intake Type", 
       y = "Duration of Stay", 
       title = "Shelter Intake Duration Distrib in Dallas Animal Shelters in 2016 and 2017")
```
